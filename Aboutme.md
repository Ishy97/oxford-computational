My name is Ismael, I am an MSc candidate in the MMES program. I joined this course to strengthen my quantitative skills so that I can supplement my qualitative research with empirically driven analysis. 

I am **particularly** interested in learning how to create maps and visualizations since my main topic of interest is regional inequality in the MENA region. This is why I am really excited to learn the basics of GIS and how to map with R.
